yum/repo

To install external yum repos you would do something like

$ rpm -ivh http://www.example.com/example-release.rpm

If you want to cryptographically verify the install of the release rpm itself you would need the key in advance.

# repo comes from an rpm externally provided
#
- name: install example yum repository
  include_role:
    name: yum/repo
    repo_name: "elrepo"
    repo_src: http://www.example.com/example-release.rpm
    repo_key:
      src: "{{ key_src }}"
      dest: "{{ key_dest }}"
      fingerprint: "{{ fingerprint }}"

When an externally rpm is not provided, you want to write your own repo file.
You don't need a key for the repo itself, obviously, but you need a key for
subsequent package installs.

# repo definition is self made
# 
- name: install gugu yum repository
  include_role:
    name: yum/repo
    repo_name: "gugu"
    repo_src: "{{ repo_src }}"
    key:
      dest: "{{ key_dest }}"
      src: "{{ key_src }}"
      fingerprint: "{{ fingerprint }}"

Is a fingerprint needed?

It's actually a little more complex because yum has multiple config directives

gpgcheck
localpkg_gpgcheck
payload_gpgcheck
repo_gpgcheck
